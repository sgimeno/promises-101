Promises 101
============

Each JS file contains an small exercise about sync/async code

# Commands

 + `npm test` to test program 1 and 2 (p1.js & p2.js)
 + `npm run spec` to see the expected output


## Exercise 1

- [ ] Read the code in `p1.js` and understand what does it
- [ ] Is it correct? If not, fix it!
- [ ] What can you tell about function `sum(a, b)` ?

## Exercise 2

- [ ] Read the code in `p2.js` and understand what does it
- [ ] Is it correct? If not, fix it (using a callback)!
- [ ] What can you tell about function `sum(a, b)` ?

## Exercise 3

- [ ] Reason about the problems of callbacks
- [ ] Refactor the previous code to use a `Promise` instead of a callback

## Exercise 4

Run `npm run wtf` and you will see the output differs from the results from the
spec.

 - [ ] Inspection `solutions/index.js` and reason why this happens
